<h2> NextMind Chess </h2>

NM Chess is a project I did at the Blue Valley Center for Advanced Professional Studies to show how Brain Computer Interfaces can be used for accesibility with computers. Although the chess game isn't perfect, and believe me there are plenty of bugs, this is meant to be more of a proof-of-concept rather than a perfect and playable game. Those will come in the future.
